# ETracker.save_data { #DeToX.ETracker.save_data }

```python
ETracker.save_data()
```

Save buffered gaze and event data to file with optimized processing.

Uses thread-safe buffer swapping to minimize lock time, then processes
and saves data in CSV or HDF5 format. Events are merged with gaze data
based on timestamp proximity.

This method is typically called automatically by `stop_recording()`, but
can be called manually during recording to periodically save data and
clear buffers. This is useful for long experiments to avoid memory buildup
and ensure data is saved even if the program crashes.

## Notes {.doc-section .doc-section-notes}

- Automatically called by `stop_recording()`
- Safe to call during active recording
- Clears buffers after saving
- Events are matched to nearest gaze sample by timestamp

## Examples {.doc-section .doc-section-examples}

```python
# Automatic saving (most common)
ET_controller.start_recording('data.h5')
# ... run experiment ...
ET_controller.stop_recording()  # Automatically calls save_data()

# Manual periodic saves for long experiments
ET_controller.start_recording('long_experiment.h5')

for trial in range(100):
    ET_controller.record_event(f'trial_{trial}_start')
    # ... present stimuli ...
    ET_controller.record_event(f'trial_{trial}_end')
    
    # Save data every 10 trials to prevent memory buildup
    if (trial + 1) % 10 == 0:
        ET_controller.save_data()  # Saves and clears buffers

ET_controller.stop_recording()

# Save data at natural break points
ET_controller.start_recording('session.h5')

# Block 1
for trial in range(20):
    # ... run trial ...
    pass
ET_controller.save_data()  # Save after block 1

# Short break
core.wait(30)

# Block 2
for trial in range(20):
    # ... run trial ...
    pass
ET_controller.save_data()  # Save after block 2

ET_controller.stop_recording()
```
