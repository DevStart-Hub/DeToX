Size settings for user interface elements.

Defines sizes for various UI components in the calibration interface.
All sizes are specified in height units (as fraction of screen height)
and are automatically converted to appropriate units based on the
PsychoPy window configuration.

## Notes {.doc-section .doc-section-notes}

Height units provide consistent visual appearance across different
screen sizes and aspect ratios. The conversion to pixels or other
units is handled automatically by the coordinate conversion functions.

## Examples {.doc-section .doc-section-examples}

```python
>>> ui_sizes = UIElementSizes()
>>> ui_sizes.highlight = 0.06  # Larger highlight circles
>>> ui_sizes.instruction_text = 0.025  # Larger instructions
```
