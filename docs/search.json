No Problem!\n\n\n\nIf you’re following along without a Tobii eye tracker connected, you can still test everything using simulation mode. Just pass simulate=True when creating your ETracker:\n\nET_controller = ETracker(win, simulate=True)\n\nThis tells DeToX to collect data from your mouse position instead of an actual eye tracker—perfect for development, testing, or learning the workflow before you have hardware access 😉\n\n\nOnce you run this code, DeToX will connect to your eye tracker and set everything up for you. It will also gather information about the connected device and display it in a nice, readable format:\n┌────────────────── Eyetracker Info ──────────────────┐\n│Connected to the eyetracker:                         │\n│ - Model: Tobii Pro Fusion                           │\n│ - Current frequency: 250.0 Hz                       │\n│ - Current illumination mode: Default                │\n│Other options:                                       │\n│ - Possible frequencies: (30.0, 60.0, 120.0, 250.0)  │\n│ - Possible illumination modes: ('Default',)         │\n└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\nThis tells us we’re connected to the eye tracker and ready to start recording data!",

Let’s keep it stupidly simple. As we show images, videos or whatnot we need to keep track at which point thesee stimuli happen in our eyetracking data. And how to do so?? well we can use the record_event function!!\n\n# Send event 1\nET_controller.record_event('wait 1')\ncore.wait(2) # wait 2s\n\n# Send event 2\nET_controller.record_event('wait 2')\ncore.wait(2) # wait 2s\n\nHere’s what’s happening:\n\ncontroller.record_event('wait 1'): Drops a timestamped marker labeled 'wait 1' into your data stream. This is like planting a flag that says “something important happened HERE.”\ncore.wait(2): Pauses execution for 2 seconds. During this time, the eye tracker keeps collecting gaze data in the background.\ncontroller.record_event('wait 2'): Plants another marker at the 2-second point, labeled 'wait 2'.\nAnother core.wait(2): Waits another 2 seconds.\n\nHere we’re just using core.wait() as a placeholder.

You have two main options:\n\nPackage Installation\nInstall PsychoPy like any other Python package using pip. This approach is flexible and ideal if you prefer working in an IDE (like Positron, VS Code, PyCharm, or Spyder) where you have full control over your Python environment.\nStandalone Installation\nUse the PsychoPy standalone installer, which bundles PsychoPy and all its dependencies into a single, ready-to-use application. This is often the easiest way to get started, especially if you’re not familiar with managing Python environments or just want to hit the ground running.\n\nWe like installing psychopy as a package but you do you!\n\nPackageStandalone\n\n\nThis method is ideal if you prefer working in an IDE (like Positron, VS Code, PyCharm, or Spyder) and want full control over your Python environment.\n\nStep 1: Create a Virtual Environment\nWe like to use miniforge to handle our environments and Python installations. Any other method would work as well, but for simplicity we’ll show you how we prefer to do it.\nWe recommend using Python 3.10 for the best compatibility:\nmamba create -n detox_env python=3.10\nThis will create an environment called detox_env with python 3.10. Exactly what we need!\nYou will probably need to confirm by pressing y, and after a few seconds you’ll have your environment with Python 3.10! Great!\n\n\nStep 2: Activate Environment and Install PsychoPy\nNow let’s activate this environment (making sure we’re using it) and then install PsychoPy:\nmamba activate detox_env\npip install psychopy\nthis will take some time but if you are lucky you will have psychopy in your enviroment\nAgain, confirm if needed and you’re done! Amazing!\n\n\n\nPsychoPy is a large package with many dependencies, and sometimes (depending on your operating system) installing it can be quite tricky! For this reason, the PsychoPy website suggests using the standalone installation method. This is like installing regular software on your computer - it will install PsychoPy and all its dependencies in one go.\n\nStep 1: Install PsychoPy Standalone\n\nGo to the PsychoPy download page\nDownload the standalone installer for your operating system\nRun the installer and follow the setup instructions\n\nYou are done!!!

Download it from git-scm.com—installation takes just a minute.\n\n\n\nPackageStandalone\n\n\nAgain make sure to be in the correct environment if you installed PsychoPy as a package. with the following command:\nmamba activate detox_env\nThen simply run:\npip install git+https://github.com/DevStart-Hub/DeToX.git\nWait a few seconds, confirm if needed, and you are done!\n\n\n\nOpen PsychoPy\nGo to Coder View (the interface with the code editor)\nOpen the Tools menu\nSelect “Plugins/package manager…”\nClick on “Packages” in the top tabs\nClick the “Open PIP terminal” button\nType the following command: pip install git+https://github.com/DevStart-Hub/DeToX.git\n\nThat’s it! You now have both PsychoPy and DeToX installed and ready to use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant: DeToX requires coding\n\n\n\nDeToX is a code-based library that works with PsychoPy’s Coder interface. If you typically use PsychoPy’s Builder (the drag-and-drop visual interface), you’ll need to switch to the Coder interface to use DeToX.

    "text": "This package was created out of the need to run eye-tracking experiments using tobii_research. The Tobii SDK provides a powerful way to interact with Tobii eye trackers in Python, offering many advanced features. However, certain aspects of its implementation can be complex and unintuitive for routine research tasks. Since we often run experiments using PsychoPy, we developed this lightweight wrapper around PsychoPy and tobii_research to simplify the process. The goal is to make it easy to run infant-friendly eye-tracking studies while handling the more technical aspects of eye tracker integration behind the scenes.\nThe beauty of DeToX lies in its simplicity - if you already have PsychoPy installed, you only need to add DeToX and you’re ready to go. No additional dependencies, no complex setup procedures. It’s just a clean, intuitive wrapper that makes eye-tracking accessible.\nThis project didn’t start from scratch—it builds upon an existing repository that we have used in the past: psychopy_tobii_infant\nWhile this repository provided solid solutions for integrating Tobii eye trackers with PsychoPy, we added features and improvements that we found useful for running infant-friendly eye-tracking studies. Our goal was to simplify some of the more technical aspects while keeping the flexibility needed for research."

When your codebase is straightforward and well-documented, it becomes a platform for innovation rather than an obstacle to overcome."

Too often, researchers encounter powerful packages that become frustrating to use due to unclear or incomplete documentation. When you’re left wondering what a function does or how to modify basic settings, the package becomes more of a hindrance than a help. A package should empower users, not confuse them. That’s why we’ve prioritized creating clear, comprehensive documentation with practical examples and step-by-step tutorials. Our goal is documentation that helps you understand not just what to do, but why—so you can confidently adapt the code to your specific experimental needs.\n\nVignettes\nOur vignettes offer hands-on explanations of DeToX’s settings and features through practical examples. Each vignette focuses on specific functionality, walking you through the implementation details and configuration options you’ll need to effectively integrate these features into your research workflow.\n\n\nTutorial\nWhile vignettes dive deep into individual features, our tutorial take a different approach - it demonstrate a complete working experiment from start to finish. Rather than explaining every parameter in detail it shows you how all the pieces fit together in real research scenarios."
