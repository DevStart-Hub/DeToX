Here we’re using 1920×1080, but adjust this to match your monitor.\nfullscr=True: Makes the window take over the whole screen—crucial for experiments where you want to eliminate distractions.\nunits='pix': Defines how you’ll specify positions and sizes throughout your experiment. DeToX supports multiple PsychoPy unit systems—'height', 'norm', 'pix'—so choose whichever you’re most comfortable with or best fits your experimental design.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWindow size\n\n\n\nIf you’re following along with this tutorial and experimenting on your own, we strongly recommend using a smaller window with fullscr=False instead of fullscreen mode. When fullscr=True, the window takes over your entire screen, making it tricky (or impossible!) to interact with your computer—like stopping the script or checking documentation. Save fullscreen for your actual experiments.\n\n\nPerfect now we have our window where we can draw images, videos and interact with them!!",

No Problem!\n\n\n\nIf you’re following along without a Tobii eye tracker connected, you can still test everything using simulation mode. Just pass simulate=True when creating your ETracker:\n\nET_controller = ETracker(win, simulate=True)\n\nThis tells DeToX to collect data from your mouse position instead of an actual eye tracker—perfect for development, testing, or learning the workflow before you have hardware access 😉\n\n\nOnce you run this code, DeToX will connect to your eye tracker and set everything up for you. It will also gather information about the connected device and display it in a nice, readable format:\n┌────────────────── Eyetracker Info ──────────────────┐\n│Connected to the eyetracker:                         │\n│ - Model: Tobii Pro Fusion                           │\n│ - Current frequency: 250.0 Hz                       │\n│ - Current illumination mode: Default                │\n│Other options:                                       │\n│ - Possible frequencies: (30.0, 60.0, 120.0, 250.0)  │\n│ - Possible illumination modes: ('Default',)         │\n└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\nThis tells us we’re connected to the eye tracker and ready to start recording data!",

If you don’t specify one, DeToX automatically generates a timestamp-based filename.\nYour eye-tracking data is now being collected continuously and will be later saved in a HDF5 format, which is ideal for storing large datasets efficiently.

It’s entirely up to you and your experimental design!\nSince this is a SUPER BASIC example to get you started, we won’t overcomplicate things with elaborate stimuli or complex tasks. Let’s keep it stupidly simple. As we show images, videos or whatnot we need to keep track at which point thesee stimuli happen in our eyetracking data. And how to do so?? well we can use the record_event function!!\n\n# Send event 1\nET_controller.record_event('wait 1')\ncore.wait(2) # wait 2s\n\n# Send event 2\nET_controller.record_event('wait 2')\ncore.wait(2) # wait 2s\n\nHere’s what’s happening:\n\ncontroller.record_event('wait 1'): Drops a timestamped marker labeled 'wait 1' into your data stream. This is like planting a flag that says “something important happened HERE.”\ncore.wait(2): Pauses execution for 2 seconds. During this time, the eye tracker keeps collecting gaze data in the background.\ncontroller.record_event('wait 2'): Plants another marker at the 2-second point, labeled 'wait 2'.\nAnother core.wait(2): Waits another 2 seconds.\n\nHere we’re just using core.wait() as a placeholder. In your actual experiment, this is where you’d display your stimuli—show images, play videos, present text, or run whatever task your study requires.

    "text": "This package was created out of the need to run eye-tracking experiments using tobii_research. The Tobii SDK provides a powerful way to interact with Tobii eye trackers in Python, offering many advanced features. However, certain aspects of its implementation can be complex and unintuitive for routine research tasks. Since we often run experiments using PsychoPy, we developed this lightweight wrapper around PsychoPy and tobii_research to simplify the process. The goal is to make it easy to run infant-friendly eye-tracking studies while handling the more technical aspects of eye tracker integration behind the scenes.\nThe beauty of DeToX lies in its simplicity - if you already have PsychoPy installed, you only need to add DeToX and you’re ready to go. No additional dependencies, no complex setup procedures. It’s just a clean, intuitive wrapper that makes eye-tracking accessible.\nThis project didn’t start from scratch—it builds upon an existing repository that we have used in the past: psychopy_tobii_infant\nWhile this repository provided solid solutions for integrating Tobii eye trackers with PsychoPy, we added features and improvements that we found useful for running infant-friendly eye-tracking studies. Our goal was to simplify some of the more technical aspects while keeping the flexibility needed for research."

Too often, researchers encounter powerful packages that become frustrating to use due to unclear or incomplete documentation. When you’re left wondering what a function does or how to modify basic settings, the package becomes more of a hindrance than a help. A package should empower users, not confuse them. That’s why we’ve prioritized creating clear, comprehensive documentation with practical examples and step-by-step tutorials. Our goal is documentation that helps you understand not just what to do, but why—so you can confidently adapt the code to your specific experimental needs.\n\nVignettes\nOur vignettes offer hands-on explanations of DeToX’s settings and features through practical examples. Each vignette focuses on specific functionality, walking you through the implementation details and configuration options you’ll need to effectively integrate these features into your research workflow.\n\n\nTutorial\nWhile vignettes dive deep into individual features, our tutorial take a different approach - it demonstrate a complete working experiment from start to finish. Rather than explaining every parameter in detail it shows you how all the pieces fit together in real research scenarios."

You have two main options:\n\nPackage Installation\nInstall PsychoPy like any other Python package using pip. This approach is flexible and ideal if you prefer working in an IDE (like Positron, VS Code, PyCharm, or Spyder) where you have full control over your Python environment.\nStandalone Installation\nUse the PsychoPy standalone installer, which bundles PsychoPy and all its dependencies into a single, ready-to-use application. This is often the easiest way to get started, especially if you’re not familiar with managing Python environments or just want to hit the ground running.\n\nWe like installing psychopy as a package but you do you!\n\nPackageStandalone\n\n\nThis method is ideal if you prefer working in an IDE (like Positron, VS Code, PyCharm, or Spyder) and want full control over your Python environment.\n\nStep 1: Create a Virtual Environment\nWe like to use miniconda to handle our environments and Python installations. Any other method would work as well, but for simplicity we’ll show you how we prefer to do it.\nWe recommend using Python 3.10 for the best compatibility:\nconda create -n detox_env python=3.10\nThis will create an environment called detox_env with python 3.10. Exactly what we need!\nYou will probably need to confirm by pressing y, and after a few seconds you’ll have your environment with Python 3.10! Great!\n\n\nStep 2: Activate Environment and Install PsychoPy\nNow let’s activate this environment (making sure we’re using it) and then install PsychoPy:\nconda activate detox_env\npip install psychopy\nthis will take some time but if you are lucky you will have psychopy in your enviroment\nAgain, confirm if needed and you’re done! Amazing!\n\n\n\nPsychoPy is a large package with many dependencies, and sometimes (depending on your operating system) installing it can be quite tricky! For this reason, the PsychoPy website suggests using the standalone installation method. This is like installing regular software on your computer - it will install PsychoPy and all its dependencies in one go.\n\nStep 1: Install PsychoPy Standalone\n\nGo to the PsychoPy download page\nDownload the standalone installer for your operating system\nRun the installer and follow the setup instructions\n\nYou are done!!!

    "text": "Part 1: Positioning Your Participant\n\nUnderstanding the Track Box\nEvery eye tracker has a track box—an invisible 3D zone where it can accurately detect eyes. Step outside this zone, and tracking quality drops fast! While we try to seat everyone consistently, even small differences in posture or chair height can matter. The good news? DeToX makes checking position as easy as calling a single method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThis tutorial assumes you’ve completed Getting started. If not, start there first!!!\n\n\n\n\nSetup Code\nLet’s begin with our standard setup:\n\nfrom psychopy import visual, core\nfrom DeToX import ETracker\n\n\n## Creat the window\nwin = visual.Window(\n    size=[1920, 1080],  # Window dimensions in pixels\n    fullscr=True,       # Expand to fill the entire screen\n    units='pix'         # Use pixels as the measurement unit\n)\n\n\n## Connect to the eyetracker\nET_controller = ETracker(win)\n\nWe’re following the same steps from the previous tutorial. First, we import the libraries we need—psychopy.visual for creating our display window and DeToX.ETracker for controlling the eye tracker.\nNext, we create a PsychoPy window where all our stimuli will appear.\nFinally, we connect to the Tobii eye tracker by creating an ETracker object. This automatically searches for connected devices, establishes communication, and links the tracker to our window. You’ll see connection info printed to confirm everything’s working. Now the ET_controller object is ready to control all eye-tracking operations!\n\n\nChecking Position in Real-Time\nNow for the magic—visualizing where your participant’s eyes are in the track box:\n\nEt_controller.show_status()\n\n\n\nWhat You’ll See\nWhen you call show_status(), an animated video of animals appears to keep infants engaged. Overlaid on the video are two colored circles—🔵 light blue and 🔴 pink —showing where the tracker detects your participant’s eyes in real-time. A black rectangle marks the track box boundaries where tracking works best.\nBelow the rectangle, a green bar with a moving black line indicates distance from the screen. The line should be centered on the bar (about 65 cm distance).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimulation Mode\n\n\n\nIf you’re running with simulate=True, the positioning interface uses your mouse instead of real eye tracker data. Move the mouse around to see the eye circles follow, and use the scroll wheel to simulate moving closer to or further from the screen.\n\n\nCenter both colored circles within the black rectangle. If they’re drifting toward the edges, ask the participant to lean in the needed direction, or adjust the eye tracker mount if possible.\nFor distance, watch the black line on the green bar. Too far left means too close (move back), too far right means too far (move forward). Aim for the center.\nPress SPACE when positioning looks good—you’re ready for calibration!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomizing the Positioning Display\nBy default, show_status() displays an animated video of animals to keep infants engaged while you adjust their position. However, you can customize this behavior using the video_help parameter:\nvideo_help=True: Uses the built-in instructional video included with DeToX (default). This is the easiest option and works well for most studies.\nvideo_help=False: Disables the video entirely, showing only the eye position circles and track box. Useful if you prefer a minimal display or if video playback causes performance issues.\nvideo_help=visual.MovieStim(...): Uses your own custom video. You’ll need to pre-load and configure the MovieStim object yourself, including setting the appropriate size and position for your display layout.",

    "text": "Part 2: Calibration\nWith your participant positioned correctly, you’re ready for calibration. But what exactly is calibration, and why do we need it?\n\nUnderstanding Calibration\nCalibration teaches the eye tracker how to interpret each participant’s unique eye characteristics. Everyone’s eyes are slightly different—different sizes, shapes, reflection patterns—so the tracker needs a personalized model to accurately estimate where someone is looking.\nThe process is straightforward: you present targets at known locations on the screen, the participant looks at each one, and the tracker records the relationship between eye features and screen coordinates. This creates a custom mapping for that individual.\n\n\n\nImage from tobii website\n\n\nSounds complex, right? It is—but DeToX handles the complexity for you. Here’s how simple it becomes:\n\n\nLaunching Calibration with DeToX\n\nET_controller.calibrate(\n    calibration_points = 5,\n    shuffle=True,\n    audio=True,\n    anim_type='zoom',\n    visualization_style='circles'\n)\n\nLet’s break down what’s happening here:\ncalibration_points=5: Uses a standard 5-point calibration pattern (corners plus center). This is the default and works well for most studies. You can also choose 9 points for higher precision, or pass a custom list of coordinates in height units for specialized configurations.\nshuffle=True: Randomizes which image appears at each calibration point. This prevents habituation and keeps participants engaged throughout the procedure.\naudio=True: Plays an attention-getting sound along with the visual stimulus to help capture and maintain the participant’s focus.\nanim_type='zoom': Makes the stimuli gently pulse in size to attract attention. You can also use 'trill' for a rotating animation.\nvisualization_style='circles': Displays the calibration results using dots at each point. You can also choose 'lines' to show lines connecting the target to where the gaze landed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomize calibration\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can customize several aspects of the calibration procedure to match your experimental needs, let’s explore some of the key parameters:\ncalibration_points: By default uses a 5-point pattern (corners plus center). You can specify 9 for higher precision, or pass a custom list of coordinates in height units for specialized configurations tailored to your stimulus regions.\ninfant_stims: By default (infant_stims=True), DeToX uses a set of engaging animal cartoons included with the package. These work well for most infant studies, but you can provide a list of file paths to your own images if you prefer custom stimuli that better match your study’s theme or participant age group.\nstim_size: This parameter controls the size of the calibration stimuli. You can choose 'small' or 'big' to adjust how large the images appear on screen. We strongly recommend using 'big' for infant and child participants to make the targets more noticeable and easier to fixate on. On the other hand, 'small' may be suitable for adult participants to achiveive higher calibration precision.\naudio: By default (audio=True), an attention-getting sound included with DeToX plays automatically when stimuli appear. Set this to None to disable audio entirely, or pass your own pre-loaded psychopy.sound.Sound object to use custom sounds that fit your experimental context.\nRemeber that while you can customize these parameters you can also use default settings to make the calibration process quick and easy. You could just call\nET_controller.calibrate()\nto run a standard 5-point calibration with default settings.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Calibration Process\n\nStep 1: Instructions\nFirst, you’ll see instructions explaining the controls:\n┌──────────────────── Calibration Setup ─────────────────────┐\n│Mouse-Based Calibration Setup:                              │\n│                                                            │\n│    - Press number keys (1-5) to select calibration points  │\n│    - Move your mouse to the animated stimulus              │\n│    - Press SPACE to collect samples at the selected point  │\n│    - Press ENTER to finish collecting and see results      │\n│    - Press ESCAPE to exit calibration                      │\n│                                                            │\n│    Any key will start calibration immediately!             │\n└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\nthese instructions will tell you how to control the calibration using your keyboard.\nPress any key when you’re ready to begin.\n\n\nData Collection\nThe calibration screen appears with a thin red border indicating you’re in calibration mode. Press a number key (1-5) to display an animated stimulus at the corresponding calibration point. The participant should look at the stimulus while it animates. When you’re confident they’re fixating on the target, press SPACE to collect gaze samples. The system waits briefly (0.25 seconds) to ensure stable fixation, then records the eye tracking data for that point. Repeat this process for all calibration points. You don’t need to go in order.\n\n\nStep 3: Review Results\nOnce you’ve collected data for all points (or whenever you’re satisfied), press ENTER to compute and visualize the calibration results. You’ll see a display showing the calibration targets and dots (or lines if you selected them in the visualization_style) to where the gaze samples actually landed.\nAt this stage, you have several options:\n┌────────────── Calibration Results ───────────────┐\n│Review calibration results above.                 │\n│                                                  │\n│    - Press ENTER to accept calibration           │\n│    - Press Numbers → SPACE to retry some points  │\n│    - Press ESCAPE to restart calibration         │\n│                                                  │\n└──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\nAccept the calibration: If the results look good across all points, press SPACE to accept and move forward with your experiment.\nRetry specific points: Notice one or two points with poor accuracy? Press the number keys corresponding to those points—they’ll highlight in yellow to confirm your selection. You can select multiple points if needed. Once you’ve marked all points for retry, press SPACE again to recollect data for just those points. This targeted approach is especially valuable with infants and children, where you might get excellent data at most points but struggle with one or two locations.\nStart over: If the overall quality is poor or you want a fresh start, press ESCAPE to discard all data and restart the entire calibration procedure from the beginning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimulation Mode\n\n\n\nWhen running with simulate=True, the calibration procedure uses mouse position instead of real eye tracker data. Press number keys to display stimuli at calibration points, move your mouse to each target location, and press SPACE to “collect” samples. This allows you to test your entire experiment workflow without needing physical eye tracking hardware.\n\n\n\n\n\nCalibration Complete!\nCongratulations! You’ve successfully positioned your participant and completed the calibration procedure using DeToX. With accurate calibration in place, you’re now ready to present your experimental stimuli and collect high-quality eye tracking data.\nHere’s a video demonstrating the entire calibration workflow from start to finish:",

    "text": "Save and Load calibration\nWhile we recommend performing calibration at the start of each session to ensure optimal accuracy, DeToX also allows you to save and load calibration data for convenience. In our opinion, this should only be used in special circumstances where there is a headrest and little to no chance of movement between sessions. However, if you need to save and reuse calibration data, here’s how:\n\nSaving Calibration\nAfter completing a successful calibration, you can save the calibration data to a file:\n# Save with custom filename\nET_controller.save_calibration(filename=\"S01_calibration.dat\")\n┌────── Calibration Saved ─────┐\n│Calibration data saved to:    │\n│S01_calibration.dat           │\n└──────────────────────────────┘\nThe calibration data is saved as a binary file (.dat format) that can be reloaded in future sessions. If you don’t specify a filename, DeToX automatically generates a timestamped name like 2024-01-15_14-30-00_calibration.dat.\nyou can also choose to use a GUI file dialog to select the save location:\n# Save with GUI file dialog\nET.save_calibration(use_gui=True)\n\n\nLoading Calibration\nTo reuse a previously saved calibration in a new session:\n# Load from specific file\nET.load_calibration(filename=\"S01_calibration.dat\")\n┌───── Calibration Loaded ──────┐\n│Calibration data loaded from:  │\n│S01_calibration.dat            │\n└───────────────────────────────┘\nor again, use a GUI file dialog to select the file:\n# Load with GUI file dialog\nET.load_calibration(use_gui=True)",
