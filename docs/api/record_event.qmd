## record_event { #record_event }

`record_event(self, event_label)`

Record an event with a timestamp.

This method adds an event to the event data buffer. The event is
represented as a list with two elements: the first element is the
timestamp of the event in milliseconds relative to the start of the
recording, and the second element is the event label provided as a
string.

The timestamp is obtained using tr.get_system_time_stamp(), which
returns the current time in milliseconds since the system was started.

If the recording is not active, a RuntimeWarning is raised.
