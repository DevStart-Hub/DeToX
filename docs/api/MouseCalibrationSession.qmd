# MouseCalibrationSession { #DeToX.MouseCalibrationSession }

```python
MouseCalibrationSession(
    win,
    infant_stims,
    mouse,
    shuffle=True,
    audio=None,
    anim_type='zoom',
)
```

Mouse-based calibration session for simulation mode.

This class provides a calibration interface for testing and development when
no physical eye tracker is available. It simulates the calibration process
using mouse position as a proxy for gaze, allowing experimenters to test
calibration procedures and develop experiments without hardware.

The mouse calibration follows the same interaction pattern as Tobii calibration,
collecting position samples at each calibration target and visualizing the
results. This ensures consistent user experience between simulation and real
data collection modes.

## Methods

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [run](#DeToX.MouseCalibrationSession.run) | Main function to run the mouse-based calibration routine. |

### run { #DeToX.MouseCalibrationSession.run }

```python
MouseCalibrationSession.run(calibration_points, num_samples=5)
```

Main function to run the mouse-based calibration routine.

Executes the complete calibration workflow using mouse position as a
proxy for gaze data. Follows the same interaction pattern as Tobii
calibration to ensure consistency across modes.

| Name               | Type                   | Description                                                                                                               | Default    |
|--------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| calibration_points | list of (float, float) | List of target positions in PsychoPy coordinates. Typically 5-9 points distributed across the screen.                     | _required_ |
| num_samples        | int                    | How many mouse position samples to collect at each calibration point. More samples provide smoother averaging. Default 5. | `5`        |

#### Returns {.doc-section .doc-section-returns}

| Name   | Type   | Description                                                                                                       |
|--------|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|        | bool   | True if calibration finished successfully and was accepted by user, False if the user exits early via escape key. |
