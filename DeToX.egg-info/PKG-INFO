# DeToX

DeToX (Developmental Tobii Experiment) is a user-friendly Python wrapper for the tobii-researcher library. It is designed to simplify the integration of Tobii eye-tracking hardware with PsychoPy, particularly for conducting developmental studies involving infants. By streamlining the process of data collection, DeToX aims to enhance the efficiency of developmental eye-tracking experiments.

## Key Features

- **Data Recording**: Seamlessly record eye-tracking data during experiments.
- **CSV Export**: Save the collected data buffer conveniently as a CSV file for further analysis.
- **Customizable Calibration**: Run eye-tracker calibration using a variety of animations tailored to engage infants.
- **Status Monitoring**: Keep track of the eye-tracker's status in real-time.

### Operational Features

- **Simulated Data Streams**: Facilitate experimental setups by simulating eye-tracker data streams, allowing for research continuity without the need for physical eye-tracking hardware.
  - **Next Steps**: Implement enhancements to the calibration process and improve status display functionalities.

### Future Enhancements

- **Gaze-Contingent Experimentation**: Develop helper functions to support gaze-contingent experimental designs, enabling more dynamic and interactive studies.
